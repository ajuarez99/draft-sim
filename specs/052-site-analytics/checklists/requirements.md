# Specification Quality Checklist: Site analytics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — vendor names kept out of spec.md; they live in research-notes.md
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — FR-006 and FR-013 resolved 2026-10-28 (see spec "Clarifications")
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The "Context" section names the SPA and the CSP because they are constraints of the existing site, not choices this spec makes.
- Two clarifications were asked and answered 2026-10-28 (hosted cookie-free service; per-league attribution, never per person). All items pass.
